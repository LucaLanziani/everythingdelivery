## AI

[AWS Bedrock adds Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/enable-generative-ai-applications-complete-tasks/) - now your future overlord can reach out to the internet and display a sense of agency. Thanks Amazon.

[OpenAI Frontier Model Forum](https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum) - What better way to build a mote than make yourself the police ... who doesn't love mixed metaphores? 
Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have announced an industry body to ensure safe and responsible development of frontier AI models - where's xAI in all this?

[Put an AI on it!](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23810360/intel-pat-gelsinger-ai-every-platform-promise)
The CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, has said they're going to put AI into every platform they build. I don't think this is a bad idea, perhaps not 100% sold. I do like the example of embedding AI in a hearing aid.

[It's an AI bubble](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-ai-the-biggest-bubble-of-all-time-stability-ai-ceo-thinks-so/)) or [maybe not](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-ai-bubble-hype-nvidia-1999-cisco-fundstrat-2023-7)
Two takes on the state of AI, the first that we're at the start of a massive AI bubble, swiftly followed a conflicting take. I'm not a financial advisor and have absolutely no reason to weigh in ... but I'm calling bubble.

[McKinsey feat Cohere](https://txt.cohere.com/cohere-and-mckinsey/)
You've probably heard of the folks at McKinsey, the global consultancy firm, you may not be familiar with Cohere. Cohere is a Canadian company founded by former members of Google Brain and authors of ['Attention is All You Need'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Read the article to find out about the new strategic alliance.

[GPT4 is getting dumberer](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/20/gpt4_chatgpt_performance/), otherwise put as the performance has been changing and perhaps the generated code isn't as good at it once was ... or maybe you're just imagining it. Just a friendly reminder, these things produce inaccurate results, do weird stuff - go ask Bard what 1 + 1 is.
