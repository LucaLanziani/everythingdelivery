This week our two themes are:

- [Whena we say data we really mean AI](#AI)
- [How do you manage a happy organisation?](#HappyOrg)

Quick reminder: we're out for August because [Luca is going on Holiday, lucky him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxauqa7rJgI). We're also changing the format, shorter runtime, more details in the footnotes and a follow-up newsletter. Why on earth don't you want to listen to us or see us? We're lovely in person and on Zoom!

## AI

[AWS Bedrock adds Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/enable-generative-ai-applications-complete-tasks/) - Now your future overlord can reach out to the internet and display a sense of agency. Thanks Amazon.

[OpenAI Frontier Model Forum](https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum) - What better way to build a mote than make yourself the police ... who doesn't love mixed metaphores? 
Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have announced an industry body to ensure safe and responsible development of frontier AI models - where's xAI in all this?

[Put an AI on it!](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23810360/intel-pat-gelsinger-ai-every-platform-promise) - The CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, has said they're going to put AI into every platform they build. I don't think this is a bad idea, perhaps not 100% sold. I do like the example of embedding AI in a hearing aid.

[It's an AI bubble](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-ai-the-biggest-bubble-of-all-time-stability-ai-ceo-thinks-so/) or [maybe not](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-ai-bubble-hype-nvidia-1999-cisco-fundstrat-2023-7) - Two takes on the state of AI, the first that we're at the start of a massive AI bubble, swiftly followed a conflicting take. I'm not a financial advisor and have absolutely no reason to weigh in ... but I'm calling bubble.

[McKinsey feat Cohere](https://txt.cohere.com/cohere-and-mckinsey/) - You've probably heard of the folks at McKinsey, the global consultancy firm, you may not be familiar with Cohere. Cohere is a Canadian company founded by former members of Google Brain and authors of ['Attention is All You Need'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Read the article to find out about the new strategic alliance.

[GPT4 is getting dumberer](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/20/gpt4_chatgpt_performance/) - Otherwise put as the performance has been changing and perhaps the generated code isn't as good at it once was ... or maybe you're just imagining it. Just a friendly reminder, these things produce inaccurate results, do weird stuff - go ask Bard what 1 + 1 is.  

[Ensure you don‚Äôt ship dud projects by overvaluing the importance of AI](https://thenewstack.io/what-generative-ai-means-for-product-strategy-and-how-to-evaluate-it/) - Even though, as established, generative AI is real and already here, there are probably loud voices from the top to the bottom of your own organization claiming that either you need AI in everything everywhere all at once or that you should be ignoring it because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a distraction.‚Äù

[I love Postgres, I love Citus](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2023/07/18/citus-12-schema-based-sharding-for-postgres/) - 
Shard your database across servers, where sharding occurs at the schema level, enjoy 
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications
- Microservices that use the same database - ü§¢
- Vertical partitioning by groups of tables

[You've gotta spend money to make money](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-losses-top-40-billion-suddenly-ok-meta-2023-7?r=US&IR=T) - Lots of people wear glasses, me included. AR requires glasses ... so spending money on AR isn't a bad idea.
"There are, you know, a billion or 2 billion people who have glasses today. I think in the future, they're all gonna be smart glasses and all the time that we spend on TVs and computers, I think that's gonna get more immersive and look something more like VR in the future," 

Only a fool would bet against Zuck and the Feta, right?

[We're doomed because of AI and data centres](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/27/thames_water_to_datacenters_cut/) - but not for the reasons you may expect. Computers need to be cooled, this requires water, maybe without the sewage, right Thames Water?

[Elon does AI](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2382426-what-is-xai-elon-musks-new-ai-company-and-will-it-succeed/) - I guess this week he's less bothered about it destroying the world, but he may have [distractions](https://themessenger.com/tech/twitters-rebrand-to-x-could-be-a-trademark-nightmare-thanks-to-microsoft)

## Happy Org

[Celebrate sleeping in the office](https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1684291048682684416?s=20) Esther Crawford is back, time to get back in the spotlight by talking about the weird shit that went down as Twitter lost staff and became an spectacle. We're not so sure there's stuff to celebrate here, seems like a TOXIC WORKPLACE. 

[DHH spits the truth on hiring](https://world.hey.com/dhh/pick-promise-over-proof-756604d3)

[GitLab‚Äôs first ESG and DIB reports](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/07/26/gitlab-first-esg-and-dib-reports/) - Check it out. We are fans of the GitLab.

[Ford CEO talks about software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IhSWsQlaG8) - There's a reason the software in your car sucks, the makers know it, some of them are starting to do something about it. An interesting take on the state of software and perhaps warning notes if you've read the statement from Intel about embedding AI in everything.

[4 day week, Luca wants 3](https://www.businessinsider.com/four-day-workweek-companies-profits-workers-happier-efficient-takano-2023-7?r=US&IR=T) - The stats are in, 4 day week is more productive, people are happier and businesses make money. Shouldn't we all be happy?

Bonus link - [ Provocative Predictions for the Future of Tech with NYU Marketing Professor Scott Galloway ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otyoPiVAicI&t=2500s). Inspiring and sad. Watch this talk, even if the data is perhaps cherry-picked.
