## Dan

Dan started his career as a biologist, earning a PhD in Computational and Mathematical Biology before falling for functional programming (Scala and Clojure).

After a postdoc, Dan moved from academia to industry to pursue applying machine learning and functional programming to business problems - he also got fed up of Tesco Value Beans.

Over the following years Dan helped deliver cloud migrations, data platforms and machine learning products. He has gained experience in a variety of domains including media, government and enterprise. 

He has worked as an individual contributor (software, ml, data) as well as a manager of software and systems engineering teams.

In his spare time Dan enjoys cycling, reading and spending time with his family, maybe in that order!
